# CarMileageHistory-AnonymizedDataVersion
Chart Car Mileage History from Anonymized Data

The problem with my ukcarmileagehistory project is the mot data site does not play well with external scripts and is constantly changing. This project aims to recreate the project, but using anonymized MOT data.

## Data Required to run this project
You will need to obtain all the MOT results from https://data.gov.uk/dataset/e3939ef8-30c7-4ca8-9c7c-ad9475cc9b2f/anonymised-mot-tests-and-results  
Then you can run

```python3 data-extract.py  

data-extract.py should be in the same folder as the data.
